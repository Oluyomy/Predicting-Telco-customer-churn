# Predicting Telco customer churn.

## Introduction: THIS PROJECT IS STILL IN PROGRESS .THANKS!

## Project  Goals
- The ultimate goal of this project is to identify the no of customer churn in this Telecomunication.


# Process
Step 1: Obtaining data
This dataset is originally  fron Kaggle
[Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle/input/telco-customer-churn/WA_Fn-UseC_-Telco-Customer-Churn)

Step 2: Loading and understanding the dataset.
-Working with WA_Fn-UseC_-Telco-Customer-Churn.csv data to understand  each feature in the dataset.
- Having a general understanding and information about the relationship between various features .

Step 3: Exploratory data analysis and pre-processing 
- clean the data sets, analyze and visualize the relationships between the different variables, handle missing values and outliers.
- Create a displot, histplot,Densityplot, scatterplot and pairplot to look at the distributions of different variables and their correlation.
- summary statistics such as mean, median, and standard deviation for each column of the dataset. 
- Learn the trend and detect outlier or possible factor that can affect the data output.
- Create heatmap to take a closer look at the corellation.
- Detect and handle outliers.
- Structure the data for efficient analysis.
- Split the into training and testing for appropriate training .
- Scale the data
